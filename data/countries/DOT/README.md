== Overview ==
The [Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Transportation_Statistics),
which is a service of the [United States Department of Transportation (US DOT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Transportation),
maintains [a list of US state and country codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_DOT_WAC),
named World Area Codes (WAC).

== WAC look-up table ==
The WAC codes themselves are listed in the so-called [WAC look-up table](http://www.transtats.bts.gov/Download_Lookup.asp?Lookup=L_WORLD_AREA_CODES).

== World Area Code table ==
The WAC table provides quite a few more details.
